# self-driving-car
this is a ai application made by python 
in this application there is a artifical nueral network which learns how to drive the car.
the user interface is simple
it uses pytorch, numpy, matplotlib etc.
it uses the concept of reinforcement learning
q-learning visualization is applied in this project
the files you need to worry about are ai.py and map.py files
other files are not important
map.py files contain the ui of the background and car 
ai.py is actually the ai or the brain of the car
